This repository focuses on exploring and understanding factors influencing customer churn. It aims to help businesses identify and address potential customer churn using survival analysis techniques. 
The given dataset includes information about subscribers, such as age, income, and tenure. The main tasks involve:
Building models to predict churn.
Comparing different models.
Selecting the most effective one.
Accelerated Time Failure (AFT) models were used to evaluate the performance of various distributions such as "extreme," "logistic," "gaussian," "weibull," "exponential," "rayleigh," "loggaussian," "lognormal," "loglogistic," and "t", and ultimately selecting the most effective model.
Additionally, the repository calculates Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) based on the chosen model and explores CLV within different customer segments.
